## Expectations and Evaluation Criteria

As experienced software engineers know, there's a wide variety of solutions to any problem. Interview coding problems can be especially unclear about expectations as the tasks can range from a quick [fizz buzz](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) screening problem to fully fledged applications. Although we've given a relatively simple problem to solve, we're looking for you to implement enough code to demonstrate expertise with domain modeling and testing.

We're interested in the thought process behind your choices, so please talk through your approach with your interviewers as you implement it. For example, you can represent your data using primitives, structs, or objects. We don't consider any one of those options better than the others. However, we expect you to make an intentional choice, implement it consistently, and communicate why you chose that approach.

In general, we're looking for a little more structure than what the problem actually necessitates. Although we understand the principle of YAGNI and the desire to keep code simple, we didn't want to add so many requirements to this exercise that it'd take a massive amount of time. Don't go overboard with this â€” we don't want to see a complex overabundance of abstraction. We also don't want to see all of the code in a single function, even though this problem is simple enough to reasonably implement it that way.

We'll be evaluating solutions on:

* object modeling / software design
* testing approach
* use of language idioms relative to expertise with that language
* thought process expressed verbally
